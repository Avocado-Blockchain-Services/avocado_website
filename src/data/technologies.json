Vertex AI is a full machine learning platform for training custom models on your proprietary data, plus access to Google's pre-trained models (PaLM, Gemini) and APIs (Vision AI, Document AI, Translation). Use OpenAI for general text generation; use Vertex AI when you need custom models, document processing, or enterprise security/compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA)."

      {
        "question": "Do we need data scientists to use Vertex AI?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily—Vertex AI AutoML lets you train custom models by uploading labeled data (images, text, tabular data) without writing code. The platform handles feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning automatically. For complex use cases (time-series forecasting, recommendation systems, custom architectures), you'll need data science expertise. Avocado provides both: AutoML implementations and custom model development."

        "question": "How does Avocado help companies adopt Vertex AI?",
        "answer": "We start with a use case workshop to identify high-ROI AI opportunities (customer service automation, fraud detection, document processing, etc.). Then we build a proof-of-concept in 2-3 weeks using Vertex AI to validate technical feasibility and business value. If successful, we develop the production system with proper ML pipelines, monitoring, and integration with your business systems. We also provide training for your team to maintain and improve models over time."

        "question": "Can Vertex AI work with our existing AWS or Azure infrastructure?",
        "answer": "Yes—Vertex AI models can be deployed via REST APIs that your AWS or Azure applications call. However, you'll get the most value by migrating ML workloads to Google Cloud where Vertex AI integrates natively with BigQuery (data warehouse), Cloud Storage, Dataflow (data pipelines), and other GCP services. Many of our clients run a hybrid setup: core applications on AWS, ML/AI on Google Cloud Platform."
