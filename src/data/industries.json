        "question": "How does Avocado handle financial data security and compliance?",
        "answer": "Avocado is ISO 27001 certified, meaning our entire development process—from code review to deployment—follows international security standards. We implement encryption at rest and in transit, multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, audit logging, and regular penetration testing. Our team has experience with GLBA, SOC 2, PCI DSS, and other financial regulations. Every project includes a security audit before production deployment."

        "answer": "Yes—we've built integrations for Temenos, Fiserv, FIS, Oracle FLEXCUBE, and other major core banking platforms. Our approach is to build a secure API middleware layer on Google Cloud Platform that connects your legacy systems to modern applications without exposing sensitive infrastructure. This allows you to launch new customer-facing features while your core systems remain untouched."

        "answer": "Simple customer portals and internal tools can be delivered in 3 weeks.

Unlike traditional agencies that quote 6-12 months, Avocado uses a fixed-scope, fixed-price model with clear deliverables and daily progress updates."

After that, most banking clients choose a dedicated team engagement for ongoing feature development, quarterly security audits, and compliance updates as regulations change. We also offer 24/7 incident response for mission-critical production systems."

        "question": "How do NFT campaigns generate revenue for sports teams?",
        "answer": "Teams sell NFT collections to fans (primary sale revenue), then earn royalties on secondary market trades (typically 5-10% of every resale). NFTs can unlock exclusive experiences (meet-and-greets, stadium tours, VIP access) that create additional sponsorship opportunities. Teams also use NFTs as loyalty rewards to increase merchandise and ticket sales. Chivas generated significant revenue and media coverage with their NFT launches."

        "question": "Do fans need to understand cryptocurrency to use your platforms?",
        "answer": "No—our fan engagement platforms are designed for mainstream users with no crypto knowledge.

For advanced users, we support MetaMask and other Web3 wallets."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to launch an NFT campaign for a sports team?",
        "answer": "A simple NFT drop (single collection, basic smart contract, credit card checkout) can launch in 2-3 weeks. More complex campaigns with multiple tiers, utility features, and custom marketplace functionality take 4-6 weeks. We handle smart contract development, marketplace frontend, payment integration, and security audits."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you build a loyalty program without blockchain technology?",
        "answer": "Yes—many of our fan engagement platforms use traditional databases for points and rewards. Blockchain makes sense when you want fans to truly own their rewards (transferable NFTs), create secondary markets for collectibles, or integrate with third-party sponsors. We recommend starting with a traditional loyalty platform and adding blockchain features later if needed."
