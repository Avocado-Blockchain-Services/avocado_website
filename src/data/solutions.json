        "question": "How accurate are AI chatbots built by Avocado?",
        "answer": "Our AI chatbots typically achieve 85-95% intent recognition accuracy after training on your specific data. Accuracy depends on the quality of your training data (support tickets, FAQs, documentation) and the complexity of customer questions. We implement confidence thresholds—if the AI is less than 80% confident in its response, it escalates to a human agent. Our chatbots for BBVA handle thousands of customer inquiries daily with high satisfaction scores."

        "question": "Can your AI chatbot integrate with our existing customer service platform?",
        "answer": "Yes—we build integrations with all major helpdesk and CRM platforms including Zendesk, Freshdesk, Salesforce, HubSpot, Intercom, and custom internal systems. The chatbot can pull customer data (account status, order history, past tickets), create new support tickets, and escalate conversations to human agents with full context. All integrations are built using secure REST APIs and OAuth authentication."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to train an AI chatbot?",
        "answer": "Initial training and deployment takes 3 weeks: Week 1 for data preparation and intent mapping, Week 2 for model training and integrations, Week 3 for testing and production deployment. After launch, the chatbot continues learning from real conversations—we recommend quarterly retraining cycles to improve accuracy as your product and common questions evolve."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between your custom chatbots and platforms like Intercom or Drift?",
        "answer": "Generic chatbot platforms are rule-based systems with limited AI capabilities—you manually create decision trees and scripted responses. Avocado builds custom conversational AI using Google Cloud Vertex AI with large language models fine-tuned on your data. Our chatbots understand context, handle complex multi-turn conversations, integrate deeply with your internal systems, and provide accurate answers to questions you never explicitly programmed. You own the code and models."

        "question": "How much does custom AI chatbot development cost?",
        "answer": "A basic AI chatbot (single channel, 20-30 common intents, simple integrations) typically runs cost-efficient fixed pricing with 3-week delivery. More complex implementations with multi-channel deployment, extensive system integrations, and advanced NLP features take 4-6 weeks. We provide transparent fixed-price quotes after analyzing your support data and requirements.

      },
      {
        "question": "Should I build on Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana?",
        "answer": "Ethereum has the largest NFT ecosystem and highest perceived value, but transaction fees (gas) can be $20-100 per mint. Polygon offers Ethereum compatibility with near-zero fees ($0.01-0.10), making it ideal for high-volume projects and mainstream users. Solana provides the fastest transactions but has a smaller NFT community. We typically recommend Polygon for sports teams and brands targeting mainstream audiences."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do users buy NFTs without owning cryptocurrency?",
        "answer": "We integrate fiat payment processors like Stripe or Crossmint that accept credit cards and debit cards. When a user purchases an NFT with USD, the payment processor converts it to cryptocurrency behind the scenes and executes the blockchain transaction. The user receives the NFT in a custodial wallet we create for them—no MetaMask setup or crypto knowledge required. Advanced users can still connect their own Web3 wallets."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do NFT royalties work and are they enforceable?",
        "answer": "Royalties are programmed into the smart contract—every time an NFT is resold, a percentage (typically 5-10%) is automatically sent to the creator's wallet address. However, royalties are only enforceable on marketplaces that respect them. OpenSea made royalties optional in 2023. A custom marketplace guarantees royalty enforcement because you control the trading platform. Royalties generate passive income from secondary market activity."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to build a custom NFT marketplace?",
        "answer": "A basic NFT marketplace (single collection, minting and trading features, one blockchain) typically requires 4 weeks at cost-efficient fixed pricing. More complex platforms with multi-chain support, auction mechanics, token-gated features, and extensive integrations take 6-8 weeks. Ongoing costs include blockchain network fees for contract deployment (one-time), IPFS storage ($50-200/month), and cloud hosting ($100-300/month)."

You own the code and can hire your own team to extend it."

        "question": "Do you provide ongoing development after the MVP launches?",
        "answer": "Yes—most SaaS clients start with a 3-week MVP, then continue with dedicated team engagement for ongoing feature development. You can choose week-to-week sprints, monthly retainers, or project-based pricing for new features. We also offer transition packages where we hand off the codebase to your internal team with documentation and knowledge transfer sessions."

      {
        "question": "How much does SaaS MVP development cost?",
        "answer": "A 3-week SaaS MVP with core features (auth, billing, admin, 3-5 custom features) runs at cost-efficient fixed pricing. More complex products with extensive third-party integrations, advanced permissions, or AI features take 4-6 weeks. We provide transparent fixed-price quotes after a free scoping call. Ongoing cloud infrastructure costs (Google Cloud Platform) typically run $100-500/month depending on usage."

        "question": "What loyalty platforms has Avocado built?",
        "answer": "Avocado built a fan engagement and loyalty platform for Bitso (Latin America's largest crypto exchange) in partnership with major sports teams—this platform won a Clio Sports Silver award in 2022. We've also delivered NFT-based loyalty systems for Chivas and Club América that reward fans with digital collectibles. These platforms have driven millions in engagement and new revenue streams."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should my loyalty program use blockchain technology?",
        "answer": "Blockchain makes sense if you want: (1) points that customers can trade or transfer to others, (2) transparent point issuance and balance verification, (3) integration with NFT collectibles or token-gated experiences. For most traditional retail loyalty programs, a conventional database-backed system is simpler and more cost-effective. We help you decide based on your business model and customer demographics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you integrate with my existing e-commerce platform?",
        "answer": "Yes—we build integrations with all major e-commerce platforms including Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and custom-built stores. The integration syncs orders, customer data, and inventory in real-time so points are awarded automatically at checkout and customers can redeem rewards directly on your site. We also integrate with POS systems for in-store point earning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you make loyalty programs more engaging than discount codes?",
        "answer": "We use gamification psychology: achievement badges for milestones, leaderboards to create competition, limited-time challenges with exclusive rewards, progress bars showing how close customers are to the next tier, and social proof showing what others are earning. The best rewards are experiences (meet-and-greets, early access, exclusive products) not just discounts. NFT collectibles work exceptionally well for younger audiences."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does custom loyalty platform development cost?",
        "answer": "A basic loyalty platform (point earning and redemption, reward catalog, user dashboard, e-commerce integration) typically takes 4 weeks at cost-efficient fixed pricing. More complex systems with gamification, mobile apps, blockchain integration, and advanced analytics require 6-8 weeks. Compare this to 3-5% transaction fees plus $500-2000/month for SaaS loyalty platforms—a custom platform pays for itself in 6-12 months for mid-size brands."
