## Services

### AI Agent Automation
Avocado builds custom AI agents that automate business workflows for small, medium, and large enterprises. We deploy agents that read data, reason over context, take real actions in your systems, and escalate to humans when judgment is needed. Three integration types: API-based (CRM, ERP, databases), browser-based (legacy systems, web apps), and human-in-the-loop (sensitive decisions, approvals).

Agent complexity ranges from conversational (FAQ, routing, responses) to workflow automation (multi-step processes across tools) to expert systems (deep domain reasoning, edge case handling, learning from feedback).

Agents run on Google Cloud Vertex AI infrastructure and can be deployed on OpenClaw, an open-source agent platform that runs on the client's own infrastructure. No vendor lock-in. Full code ownership.

### Digital Product Development
Full-stack apps, platforms, and tools. Concept to launch in 1-3 weeks.

### AI-Powered Experiences
