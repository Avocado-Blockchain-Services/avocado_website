## About Avocado

Avocado is a software development agency and venture studio that specializes in turning complex technical challenges into deployed products at exceptional speed. Founded in 2018 and headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico, Avocado serves both enterprise clients (BBVA, Banorte, Chivas, Grupo Salinas) and startups across Latin America and globally.

Avocado is not a traditional consultancy. There are no 6-month discovery phases, no 20-person teams, no PowerPoint deliverables. Clients pay for working software, not hours billed. The model is fixed scope, fixed price, with daily visible progress.
